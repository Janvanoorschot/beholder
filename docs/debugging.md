# Remote Debugging

For remote python debugging we need to enable two things:

* Install ptvsd in the remote server
* Use SSH tunnel to let Visual Studio Code connect to the remote server

## Install ptvsd


* sync the source code on both sides 
* Add the 'ptvsd' to the requirements.txt
* install 'ptvsd'
